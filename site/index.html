    Welcome to Brie Doom!
  </h1>

  <p>
    Brie Doom is a source port of the original Doom source code from C to Eiffel.
    The aim of this port is to produce idiomatic object-oriented Eiffel code with contracts
    while maintaining the original experience of playing vanilla Doom.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is an example of applying
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design by Contract</a>
    (DbC) in game development.
    Already in the current phase of development we managed to find
    several bugs in the original game thanks to DbC.
  </p>
  <p>
    Brie Dooom uses SDL2 library instead of the original X11. The SDL2 support
    is based on
    <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/">Chocolate&nbsp;Doom</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Converting procedual C code to the object-oriented paradigm of Eiffel
    introduces several challenges. Examples of such challenges are known
    in scientific literature. Also, some specifics of converting Doom to non-C
    languages are also presented on Mocha Doom website's
    <a href="http://mochadoom.sourceforge.net/tech.html">Programming page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Brie is pronounced /briÀê/ like in brie cheese.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stay tuned for further updates!

      Phase 1: Direct Port (in progress)
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the first phase, we try to port the game while preserving
      as much of the original code structure as possible.
    </p>
    <div class="w-full bg-california-200 h-6">
      <div
        class="bg-california-500 text-center text-white h-full text-base"
        style="width: {{ site.data.functions_ported.ported_ratio }}%;"
      >
        {{ site.data.functions_ported.ported_ratio }}%
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Currently {{ site.data.functions_ported.ported_ratio }}% of the original functions
      are ported in Eiffel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all original functions are counted, though. Some of them are
      are related to X11 which is replaced with SDL2 in the port.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="{{ '/ported-functions-breakdown' | relative_url }}">Ported Functions Breakdown</a>
      page for a detailed analysis.

      Phase 2: Refactoring (not started)
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the second phase, we will refactor the code to improve quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main objective of this project is improving quality of the original code.
      In the context of
      <a href="https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010">ISO 25010</a>
      quality model, we mostly aim at improving the overall <i>maintainability</i>
      and <i>functional stability</i>.
      To achieve these goals we will use features and principles implemented in
      Eiffel such as Design by Contract, Void Safety, Command-Query Separation
      and OOP practices overall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Implementing these principles will require modification of the original
      code structure such as extracting more classes, converting functions
      to commands or queries, rethinking module obligations for implementing
      concise but effective contracts.
    </p>
