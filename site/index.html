  Welcome to Brie Doom!
</h1>

<div class="space-y-2">
  <p>
    Brie Doom is a source port of the original Doom source code from C to Eiffel.
    The aim of this port is to produce idiomatic object-oriented Eiffel code with contracts
    while maintaining the original experience of playing vanilla Doom.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is an example of applying
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design by Contract</a>
    (DbC) in game development.
    Already in the current phase of development we managed to find
    several bugs in the original game thanks to DbC.
  </p>
  <p>
    Brie Dooom uses SDL2 library instead of the original X11. The SDL2 support
    is based on
    <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/">Chocolate&nbsp;Doom</a>.

  <p>
    Converting procedual C code to the object-oriented paradigm of Eiffel
    introduces several challenges. Examples of such challenges are known
    in scientific literature. Also, some specifics of converting Doom to non-C
    languages are also presented on Mocha Doom website's
    <a href="http://mochadoom.sourceforge.net/tech.html">Programming page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Brie is pronounced /briÀê/ like in brie cheese.

    Stay tuned for further updates!
