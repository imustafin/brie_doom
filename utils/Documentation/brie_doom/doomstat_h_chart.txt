	description: 
		"doomstat.h
		All the global variables that store the internal state.
		 Theoretically speaking, the internal state of the engie
		 should be found by looking at the variables collected
		 here, and every relevant module will have to include
		 this header file.
		In practice, things are a bit messy."
