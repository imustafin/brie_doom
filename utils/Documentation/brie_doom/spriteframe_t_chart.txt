General
	cluster: brie_doom
	description: 
		"spriteframe_t from r_defs.h
		
		Sprites are patches with a special naming convention
		so they can be recognized by R_InitSprites.
		
		The base name is NNNNFx or NNNNFxFx, with
		x indicating the rotation, x = 0, 1-7.
		The sprite and frame specified by a thing_t
		is range checked at run time.
		A sprite is a patch_t that is assumed to represent
		a three dimensional object and may have multiple
		rotations pre drawn.
		Horizontal flipping is used to save space,
		thus NNNNF2F5 defines a mirrored patch.
		Some sprites will only have one picture used
		for all views: NNNNF0"
