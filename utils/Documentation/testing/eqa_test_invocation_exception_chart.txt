	EQA_TEST_INVOCATION_EXCEPTION

General
	cluster: testing
	description: 
		"Objects representing an exception raised while invoking a test class and/or feature.
		
		Note: EQA_TEST_INVOCATION_EXCEPTION does not only contain the exception information, it also
		      analyses the stack trace to determine whether the implementation or the test code is
		      to blame.
		
		TODO: Take stack frames of agent calls into account, meaning that even though {PROCEDURE}.fast_call
		      causes a precondition violation, the stack frame calling the agent is to blame."
