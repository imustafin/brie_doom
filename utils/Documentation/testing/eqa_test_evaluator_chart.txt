	EQA_TEST_EVALUATOR [G -> EQA_TEST_SET create default_create end]

General
	cluster: testing
	description: 
		"Objects that are able to run tests in a protected environment and provide information whether
		the test has failed or succeeded.
		
		Note: Evaluator is not able to recover from all exceptions. Tests causing seg-faults or out-of-
		      memory exceptions might put evaluator in an unstable state."
