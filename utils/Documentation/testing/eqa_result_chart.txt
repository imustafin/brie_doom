General

	description: 
		"Responce produced from executing an Eiffel test
		
		TEST_OUTCOME holds information about the tree stages each test execution consists of: setup, test
		and teardown. Based on that information it tries to determine whether the implementation passes
		or fails the test. If an unexpected error occurred during execution, it will blame the test by
		setting is_maintenance_required to True. Somethimes the error prevents to determine wheter the
		implementaion has passed or failed the test. In that case a outcome is said to be unresolved."
