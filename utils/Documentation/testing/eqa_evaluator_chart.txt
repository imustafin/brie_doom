	EQA_EVALUATOR

General
	cluster: etf
	description: 
		"Core implementation for root class of test executor. The test evaluator is used by the
		testing tool to run tests and retrieve results. Any descendant of this class should be used as
		the root class of an interpreter. Descendants need to provide EQA_EVALUATOR information on
		what test classes/routines are available and be able to create instances of them."
